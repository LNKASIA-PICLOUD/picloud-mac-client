Enhancement: Pause synchronization when a captive portal is detected

An encrypted connection to a captive portal will use an unknown certificate, which in turn will caused a dialog to be shown by the client.
This is now changed: when a captive portal is detected by the OS, the client now shows in the account status that it cannot connect to the server because of a captive portal.

Supported OSses: Windows, Linux (with some network managers)
