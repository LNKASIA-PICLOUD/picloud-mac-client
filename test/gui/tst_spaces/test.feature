Feature: Project spaces
    As a user
    I want to sync project space
    So that I can do view and manage the space

    Background:
        Given user "Alice" has been created on the server with default attributes and without skeleton files
        And the administrator has created a space "Project101"


    Scenario: User with viewer role can open the file
        Given the administrator has created a folder "planning" in space "Project101"
        And the administrator has uploaded a file "testfile.txt" with content "some content" inside space "Project101"
        And the administrator has added user "Alice" to space "Project101" with role "viewer"
        And user "Alice" has set up a client with space "Project101"
        Then user "Alice" should be able to open the file "testfile.txt" on the file system
        And as "Alice" the file "testfile.txt" should have content "some content" on the file system


    Scenario: User with viewer role cannot edit the file
        Given the administrator has created a folder "planning" in space "Project101"
        And the administrator has uploaded a file "testfile.txt" with content "some content" inside space "Project101"
        And the administrator has added user "Alice" to space "Project101" with role "viewer"
        And user "Alice" has set up a client with space "Project101"
        Then user "Alice" should not be able to edit the file "testfile.txt" on the file system
        Then as "Alice" the file "testfile.txt" of space "Project101" should have content "some content" in the server


    Scenario: User with editor role can edit the file
        Given the administrator has created a folder "planning" in space "Project101"
        And the administrator has uploaded a file "testfile.txt" with content "some content" inside space "Project101"
        And the administrator has added user "Alice" to space "Project101" with role "editor"
        And user "Alice" has set up a client with space "Project101"
        When the user overwrites the file "testfile.txt" with content "some content edited"
        And the user waits for file "testfile.txt" to be synced
        Then as "Alice" the file "testfile.txt" of space "Project101" should have content "some content edited" in the server
