TODO: move to patch-release checklist * [ ] Make sure to increase the version number of the branched of release, e.g. if you release 2.3.2 then you should change VERSION.cmake in 2.3 to 2.3.3 since that branch now will be 2.3.3

### 15 minutes after after release:
* [ ] Test all advertised download links to have the expected version
* [ ] Check for build errors in OBS, do
```obs-deepcopy-prj.sh isv:ownCloud:desktop isv:ownCloud:desktop:client-2.X.X```
