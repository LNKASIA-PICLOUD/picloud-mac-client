 * Determines the state the wizard is in. The number of states is equal to the number of pages in the pagination.

 * Every state may be represented by more than one class. These classes can be used like different "strategies".
 * For instance, we have two different credentials state implementations representing different authentication
 * methods.
 *
 * Since we need to decide which states to have at compile time, disabling or hiding optional states must be taken
 * care of by the pagination class. All states have to be added here nevertheless.
